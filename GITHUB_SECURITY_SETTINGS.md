# 🔒 GitHub Repository Security Settings

After publishing your repository, enable these critical security features:

## 🚨 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Do These First!)

### 1. Repository Settings → Security
- **Enable:** Secret scanning alerts
- **Enable:** Dependency graph
- **Enable:** Dependabot alerts
- **Enable:** Dependabot security updates

### 2. Branch Protection (Settings → Branches)
Create rule for `main` branch:
- ✅ Require pull request reviews before merging
- ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
- ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
- ✅ Include administrators
- ✅ Restrict pushes that create files with secrets

## 🛡️ Advanced Security Features

For CI/CD (if needed later):

- Never use repository secrets for Discord tokens in public repos

## 🔍 Monitoring Setup

### Security Advisories
- Settings → Security → Security advisories
- Enable private vulnerability reporting

### Notifications
- Watch repository for security alerts
- Configure email notifications for vulnerabilities

## 👥 Collaboration Security

### Issue Templates
- ✅ Already configured with security warnings
- Users cannot accidentally share tokens in issues

### Pull Request Template  
- ✅ Security checklist included
- Contributors must confirm no secrets committed

### Contributor Guidelines
- ✅ CONTRIBUTING.md with security requirements
- ✅ SECURITY.md with vulnerability reporting process

## 🚫 What NOT to Enable (Security Risks)

- **Auto-merge:** Could bypass security checks
- **Allow force pushes:** Could overwrite security protections
- **Allow deletions:** Could remove security history

## 📋 Monthly Security Checklist

- [ ] Review Dependabot alerts

If secrets are exposed:
